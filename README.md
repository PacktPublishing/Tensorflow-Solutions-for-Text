## About the Video Course
This volume introduces working with text, with a focus on the most plentiful source of text out there: email. Working with email text from your own Gmail account, you will build up a label predictor, similar in effect to the technology Google uses to power the Social and Promotions tabs. With this technique, you will be able to build your own email classification and automated workflow hooks.
